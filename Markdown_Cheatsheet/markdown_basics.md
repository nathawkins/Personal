# Markdown Basics
We are going to use markdown to make a markdown cheatsheet!

## Headlines, Paragraphs, and Basic Formatting

### Headlines
#### Heading level 4
##### Heading level 5
###### Heading level 6

### Paragraphs and Line Breaks
We create paragraphs by typing the way we would with any other program. Just hit return twice to start another paragraph.

Where you see empty space between blocks of text in markdown, you will see empty space separating those blocks of text in your formatted HTML document.

I love you without knowing how, or when, or  
from where  
I love you directly without problems or pride:  
I love you like this because I don't know any  
other way to love  

Neruda, Pablo. "Sonnet 17" The poetry of Pablo Neruda, edited by Ilan Stavans.

### Emphasis and Bolding
#### Italics

This *works* and this _works_, too.

#### Bolding
This **works** and this __works__, too.

This ***works***, and this would ___work___, too.

### Blockquotes

>Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read  and easy-to-write as possible.
>
>Reliability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags for formatting instruction. - [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "The Father of Markdown")
