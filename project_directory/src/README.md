All code for the project is included in this directory. The directory is broken into three subdirectories:

* `data_processing_scripts`: Scripts to do the necessary pre-processing of the data before being utilized in the analysis scripts.

* `data_analysis_scripts`: Scripts that perform the necessary analysis of the project. Any figures should be saved in the `results` directory in the main project_directory in the `figures` subdirectory for each date's analysis folder.

* `supplemental_scripts`: Additional code lives here. These could include shell scripts for creating Docker images of the code, files to house lengthy coded functions (e.g. header files for C++, python files containing large functions, etc.), or additional pieces of code needed in the project that do not fall into either other category.
