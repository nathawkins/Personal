# Basic Journal Application

## The Gist of It

This application is run through a terminal window. It uses a SQLite database connection to store text entries in a `.db` file format. Some basic functionality includes writing entries to file, viewing entries at a later time, and searching for entries based on a query (in the form of a string input).

## Requirements

This program uses the Python library peewee, which is a third party, non-standard Python package. To install, open a terminal window and run `pip install peewee`.

The app will now be useable.  
**Note**: Running this application will create a `.db` file. This file needs to remain in the same directory as the application. Deleting the database file will delete all of the entries.
