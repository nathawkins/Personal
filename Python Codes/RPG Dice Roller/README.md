# RPG Dice Roller Terminal Application

## Purpose

I, like most nerds, enjoy pleasant evenings playing roleplaying tabletop games. My favorite, of course, being Dungeons and Dragons. This application runs in MacOS and Ubuntu Terminal.

### Required Package
This code does use the `more_itertools` package in python. In order to install, run command `pip install more_itertools` in your home directory.

## How the App Works
When you run the python code, it will prompt you to enter what die you want to roll. You must specify this in the traditional RPG format `(# of die to roll)d(# of sides of die)`. A 20 sided die (used most frequently) would have an input of `1d20`. You will then be prompted to enter a bonus to your roll. Examples being `+5` or  `-2`. Then, your net roll will be returned after adding your bonuses. Unless, that is, you roll a natural 1 or a natural 20. In which case, a new message will appear.

## Motivation
I love playing with people, but sometimes individuals forget their die or have to Skype into a session and need a way to roll. Screen sharing or computer based rolling provides an easy out for these issues. This was also a fun project for me to make and rather simple.
